myFtp_MiloAnton is a lightweight ftp server and client based on the RFC.

> The purpose of this challenge is to create an FTP client and server. 
You CAN use any protocol you want [ if interested, you can check and respect the RFCs] 

This text you see here is written with lots of love ! To get a feel
for a great README.md file.

## Installation

myFtp_MiloAnton requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies with ```npm install``` before tryinbg to use either the server or the client (do this in each folder).

```sh
npm install
```

You have several choices to run, build, and start a transcrypted version of either the server or the client : 

```sh
npm run dev #Used to try it in a dev environment 
npm run build #Transcypt the code thanks to Babel
npm run start #Production environment, best performance you can get 
```
